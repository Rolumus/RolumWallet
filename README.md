# About project
ROLUM is an independent, privacy-centric blockchain purpose-built for secure, anonymous transactions in a trustless environment.

# Features

Autonomous Privacy Kernel (APK)
ROLUM operates on a self-contained privacy engine that integrates custom-built zk-SNARKs with dynamic anonymity sets, ensuring transactions remain unlinkable — without dependence on third-party protocols or mixers.

Zero-Relay Architecture
Unlike chains that rely on relayers or bridges, ROLUM uses a native peer-to-peer broadcasting protocol with onion-routing-like packet randomization, preserving user metadata anonymity even at the network layer.

Dual-Stealth Addressing
Every transaction uses ephemeral dual-stealth addresses (sender + receiver) that are never reused, generated via deterministic stealth key derivation, making chain-wide address clustering impossible.

Stateless Validation Nodes
ROLUM introduces stateless consensus nodes that verify transactions without needing full chain history, reducing storage bloat and increasing decentralization — while maintaining privacy through homomorphic integrity proofs
